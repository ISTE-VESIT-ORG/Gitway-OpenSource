<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Workshop

### What do you mean by open-source contribution?

Open-Source Software is a type of software whose code is publicly available to use and modify. Open-Source Contribution involves contributing to the development or improvement of open-source software.

Some popular Open-Source Software are the Linux Operating System, Android, Mozilla Firefox, Chromium (which powers Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge), VSCode IDE, VLC Media Player, WordPress Content Manager System, etc.
<br /><br />

### Why should I contribute to open-source?

Ever wonder if all these projects/software were single-handedly maintained by a single developer?
What would have been its impact on them and pretty much on us?

The software would not have had so many features and upgradations. This is where open source contribution comes in. Contributors from around the world help develop and improve the software for every one of us who use it. Being a contributor will give you the super-power to be a part of something that is impacting so many lives.

Apart from the impact that you get to create, it also helps you become a better developer and with time a good mentor, leader, and passionate team player.

In this workshop we learn about :

-   Concept of Version Control
-   Project management and Collaborating with teams
-   Website hosting with GitHub pages
-   Contributing to Open Source
